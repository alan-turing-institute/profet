# profet
A Python 3  **pro**tein structure **fet**cher. Retrieves the cif or pdb files from either the RCSB Protein Data Bank ([PDB](https://www.rcsb.org), using [pypdb](https://github.com/williamgilpin/pypdb)) or [Alphafold](http://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) using the [Uniprot](http://uniprot.org/) ID.

## Dependencies

Please install the latest version of PyPDB using:

```sh
pip install pypdb
```

or

```sh
pip install git+git://github.com/williamgilpin/pypdb
```

## Installation

### For users

Install `profet` using pip:

```sh
pip install profet
```

### For developers

To install the development version, which contains the latest features and fixes, install directly from GitHub using:

```sh
pip install git+git://github.com/alan-turing-institute/profet
```

To test the installation, navigate to the root directory of the package and run

```sh
pytest
```

This code has been designed and tested for Python 3.

## Usage

This package can be used to retrieve the available protein structure from any Uniprot ID. It can also be used to automatically delete signal peptides off the structure.

### Python API Usage

The `Fetcher` class can search the IDs in both PDB and Alphafold, and saves the search results in a dictionary.

`get_file` returns the structure corresponding to `uniprot_id` in the defined `filetype:` (default as `'pdb'`, option as `'cif'`), searching first in the defaulted database `db` (default as `'pdb'`, option as `'alphafold'`).
The files can be saved to a local file with `filesave`: the files are saved as `uniprotID.<filetype>`, except when the files are fetched from PDB and, in that case, are saved as `uniprotID_pdbID.<filetype>`.

`set_default_db` changes the default database into the given one between `'pdb'` and `'alphafold'`.

`set_directory` changes the directory where the files are saved. Files save as `<directory>/<id>.<filetype>`.

Run `search_history()` to see the search history of the fetcher.

#### Example:

```python
import profet as pf
fetcher = pf.Fetcher()
fetcher.set_directory("/path/to/directory/folder")
fetcher.get_file(uniprot_id = "P61316", filetype = "pdb", filesave = True, db = "alphafold")

fetcher.search_history()
```

returns:
```
{'P61316': ['pdb', 'alphafold']}
```

Loads `profet` and the file-fetcher, then specifies a directory to save the files at.
Lastly, downloads the protein with uniprod ID "P61316", in pdb format from the Alphafold databank and saves it in the specified directory.

For more detailed examples consult the following [Python notebook](./run_profet.ipynb).

### Signal Peptide Cleaving Usage

Once a structure is downloaded using `get_file`, the signal cleaving function `cleave_off_signal_peptides` from the `Fetcher` class, compares the sequence of the structure to the UniProt database for any signal peptides included in the structure. It then automatically deletes the signal peptides from the structure.
The cleaved structure is saved as a separate file, with the deleted residue positions added to the filename. In the case of no signal peptides being detected, as new file named "structure-ID_None.cif/.pdb" will be saved.

#### Example:

```python
import profet as pf
fetcher = pf.Fetcher()
fetcher.set_directory("/path/to/directory/folder")
fetcher.get_file(uniprot_id = "P0A855", filetype = "pdb", filesave = True, db = "alphafold")
fetcher.cleave_off_signal_peptides("P0A855")
```
This will save p0a855.pdb and p0a855_cleaved_1to21.pdb to the specified directory.
